## Humble + Fortress (Ubuntu 22.04)

### Dependencies

In addition to ROS2 Humble and [Gazebo Fortress installations](https://gazebosim.org/docs/fortress/install_ubuntu), we need to manually install interfaces between ROS2 and Gazebo sim as follows,

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-ros-gz-sim ros-humble-ros-gz-bridge ros-humble-ros-gz-interfaces 
```
Remainder of the dependencies can be installed with [rosdep](http://wiki.ros.org/rosdep)

```bash
# From the root directory of the workspace. This will install everything mentioned in package.xml
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

### Source Build

```bash
colcon build --packages-select bcr_bot
```

### Binary Install
To install BCR bot in the binaries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-humble-bcr-bot
```

### Run

To launch the robot in Gazebo,
```bash
ros2 launch bcr_bot ign.launch.py
```
To view in rviz,
```bash
ros2 launch bcr_bot rviz.launch.py
```

### Configuration

The launch file accepts multiple launch arguments,
```bash
ros2 launch bcr_bot ign.launch.py \
	camera_enabled:=True \
	stereo_camera_enabled:=False \
	two_d_lidar_enabled:=True \
	position_x:=0.0 \
	position_y:=0.0  \
	orientation_yaw:=0.0 \
	odometry_source:=world \
	world_file:=small_warehouse.sdf
```
**Note:** To use stereo_image_proc with the stereo images excute following command: 
```bash
ros2 launch stereo_image_proc stereo_image_proc.launch.py left_namespace:=bcr_bot/stereo_camera/left right_namespace:=bcr_bot/stereo_camera/right
```
### Mapping with SLAM Toolbox

SLAM Toolbox is an open-source package designed to map the environment using laser scans and odometry, generating a map for autonomous navigation.

To start mapping:
```bash
ros2 launch bcr_bot mapping.launch.py
```

Use the teleop twist keyboard to control the robot and map the area:
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard cmd_vel:=/bcr_bot/cmd_vel
```

To save the map:
```bash
cd src/bcr_bot/config
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f bcr_map
```

### Using Nav2 with bcr_bot

Nav2 is an open-source navigation package that enables a robot to navigate through an environment easily. It takes laser scan and odometry data, along with the map of the environment, as inputs.

To run Nav2 on bcr_bot:
```bash
ros2 launch bcr_bot nav2.launch.py
```
